### Troubleshooting: 
#### No comms? 
What's the bridge doing?

#### No robot code, even after pushing? 

Check if you have a null pointer error. If you do, it's most likely a bug with the vision code. Grab a more experienced programmer to check it out.

#### Driverstation not letting you open shuffleboard? 
Open shuffleboard manually, outside of the driver station. The correct layout should still show up.
